Question:
Longest Common Subsequence & Longest Common Substring  
Answer:  
Longest Common Subsequence  
Ex.  
String1: **abc**da**f**  
String2: **a**c**bcf**  
Common Sub String: abcf  

Longest Common Substring  
Ex.  
String1: a**bcd**af  
String2: z**bcd**f  
Common Sub String: bcd  

Question:  
Longest Increasing Subsequence  
```
Input  : arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 1, 20}
Output : Length of LIS = 3
The longest increasing subsequence is 3, 10, 20

Input  : arr[] = {3, 2}
Output : Length of LIS = 1
The longest increasing subsequences are {3} and {2}
```

Question:  
Minimum Edit Distance  
Answer:  
Ex.
```
Input:   str1 = "geek", str2 = "gesek"
Output:  1
We can convert str1 into str2 by inserting a 's'.

Input:   str1 = "cat", str2 = "cut"
Output:  1
We can convert str1 into str2 by replacing 'a' with 'u'.

Input:   str1 = "sunday", str2 = "saturday"
Output:  3
Last three and first characters are same.  We basically
need to convert "un" to "atur".  This can be done using
below three operations. 
Replace 'n' with 'r', insert t, insert a
```

Questions Links for recursive, topdown and bottom-up approach  
1. 0/1 Knapsack (6 problems)  
    1.1. Subset Sum  
    1.2. Equal Sum Partition
    1.3. Count the Subset Sum with a given sum
2. Unbounded Knapsack (5 problems)  
3. Fibonacci (7 problems)
